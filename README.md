//USE THIS SITE TO HANDLE ALL PROJECT FILES

Github is a complicated website that handles code and all sorts of software developer tools.
It may seem like a very complicated way to deal with C files, but it is not that hard to maintain basic features.
You can download a zip file of all the files you need, and edit them in your home computer.
If you wish to make any edits, you can rename the file and then submit the file over here, or write them in pastebin.com

To use pastebin, do the following:

1. Go to pastebin.com
2. Paste your code, with necessary comments
3. In Syntax Highlighting, "None" is selected. Click it, and set it to "C"
4. Make sure to put a lablel in the Paste Name, at the bottom
5. Click "Create New Paste" after steps 1 to 4 has been completed.
6. You may be asked to complete Captcha verification, or not. But when you are done, you will be greeted with a new screen saying your paste has been created.
7. Copy the link of that page, from the browser.
8. Paste that link in the Messenger group.

*DO NOT PASTE THE CODE INTO THE MESSENGER GROUP DIRECTLY

All small changes matter.
